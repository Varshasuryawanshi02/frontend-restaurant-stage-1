### Restaurant Reviews App—Stage 1

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

I was provided code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any of the standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. I had to update this code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Steps to complete this project

1.Fork and clone the starter repository. The code in the repository served as my baseline to begin development.
2.I had to get a MapBox API key. Then replace the text <your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>inside of then main.js with my key. MapBox API was free to use, without providing any payment information.
3.Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .
   1.Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks could not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS. ( I should have paid better attention to this instruction as my first attempt was completed with Bootstrap...I had to go back and redo this part :| )
   2.Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
   3.Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
   4.Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
   5.Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device

### Note about ES6

 I tried to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript I wrote.
